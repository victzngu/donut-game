# Basic Browser JavaScript - Donut Maker

###### A tribute to [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/)

# The Scenario - Welcome to Fred the Baker Baking Company!

You have been contracted by Fred the Baker Baking Company to take a concept, Donut Maker Clicker, from the drawing board to the browser. Fred the Baker is tired of making real donuts and is ready to retire. He needs our help to keep his love of donuts alive. He wants you to create a game that uses button clicks to create virtual donuts for the world to enjoy. It's always "Time to make the Donuts" and Fred is too busy to give us guidance on how to implement these requirements.

# The Application Requirements
You must create a website that uses button clicks to create donuts. The donuts can be used as currency to buy Auto Clickers, which will be used to make even more donuts!

# Terminology
**Donut Count**
- The number of Donuts you have created by clicking, either manually or with an Auto Clicker.

**Auto Clicker**
- Auto Clickers will automatically click for us every second, so we don't have to click manually.

**Auto Clicker Count**
- The number of Auto Clickers purchased. Auto Clickers apply one click per second for every Auto Clicker purchased.

| Number of Auto Clickers Purchased | Clicks applied per second |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|
|1 |	1 |
|2	|2 |
|3	|3 |
...you get the picture

**Auto Clicker Cost**
- The number of donuts required to purchase an Auto Clicker. Starting cost is 100 donuts. For each Auto Clicker purchased, the cost of the next Auto Clicker increases by 10%.

|Next Auto Clicker Purchase|	Cost|
|--------------------------| ----- |
|1	|100 donuts
|2	|110 donuts
|3	|121 donuts
|4	|133 donuts


# Index.Html Setup
### Create a Main section that contains:
- A section that handles a click
  - Contains a button that can be clicked to make donuts.
  - Displays the amount of Donuts made.
- A section that interacts with the AutoClicker
  - Displays the amount of Auto Clickers purchased.
  - Provides a button to purchase Auto Clickers.
  - Button is disabled when you do not have enough Donuts to buy an Auto Clicker.

# Donut Maker Functions
#### Create functions in your DonutMaker class that perform the following actions:

- Adds a donut to the Donut Count for every button click
- Returns the Donut Count to the display
- Purchases Auto Clickers with donuts
- Checks whether you have enough donuts to purchase an Auto Clicker
- Increases the count of Auto Clickers with each purchase of an Auto Clicker
- Increases Auto Clicker cost with each purchase of an Auto Clicker
- Activates the Auto Clicker by applying clicks every second based on the Auto Clicker count
- Resets the game state. This action should reset the game to zero donuts and zero Auto Clickers

# Iterations
Whew...I need a donut after all that information! Don't worry, we are going to break it all down into iterations and features and tackle them one by one. After all, how do you eat an entire box of donuts? One donut at a time, of course.

Each iteration will focus on building out a part of the game. The first iterations will focus on the logic that is needed to have a game. The latter will take us into linking the JavaScript into our website.
----
## Iteration 1
This iteration covers project setup and starting the creation of the game. Our first iterations are going to focus on the logic that is needed to have a game. The JavaScript for this iteration will be solely in a app.js file and not pertain to the html page. We need to code some behavior before we can code the way the user interacts with the project.

### FEATURE 1 : Have a way to count donuts.
> As a user, I want to know how many donuts I have created, so that I know what my score is.
- Can add to donut count.
- Can retrieve a donut count.
 
### FEATURE 2 : Be able to purchase the first Auto Clicker with 100 donuts from your donut count.
> As a user, I want to be able to purchase Auto Clickers, so that I don't have to keep clicking a button all day.
- Can retrieve an Auto Clicker count.
- Can add to the Auto Clicker count.
- Subtract the Auto Clicker cost from your donut count.

### FEATURE 3 : The cost of each Auto Clicker will go up with each purchase.
> As a game designer, I want the game to become more difficult as the game progresses, so that users will continue to play the game.
- Increase the cost of the second Auto Clicker by an additional ten percent.
- Increase the cost of every additional Auto Clicker by an additional ten percent.

### FEATURE 4 : Ensure that there are enough clicks to buy a Auto Clicker.
> As the game designer, I want to ensure that players have to put the game into a proper state to be able to purchase a Auto Clicker, so that the game has a challenge.
- Prevent the Auto Clicker count from going up if there are not enough clicks to purchase a Auto Clicker.

### FEATURE 5 : The amount of Auto Clickers affect the amount of donuts added when an 'Activate Auto Clickers' event is called.
> As a user, I want to be able to purchase Auto Clickers, so that I don't have to keep clicking a button all day.
- When the 'activate Auto Clickers' event is executed, increase the donut total by the amount of Auto Clickers owned.
----
## Iteration 2
This iteration will prepare the html document for the game. Open the index.html file and start adding the elements you'll need. Maintain the structure of the HTML with semantic html elements and use BEM to give useful class attribute names to your elements. Use a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to achieve the trickier features below.

### FEATURE 1 : Create a button to click.
> It's Time! As a player, I want to have a button to click, so that I can start making donuts.
- In the main section of the page, create a button element.
- Label the button clearly as the button that needs to be clicked.

#### FEATURE 2 : Create a click count element.
> As a player, I want to know how many donuts I have, so that I can track my progress.
- Create an element that will provide the user with the donut count.

### FEATURE 3 : Create a section for the Auto Clickers
> As a user, I want to be able to buy and see how many Auto Clickers I have, so that I don't have to keep clicking all the time.
- Create an section of elements that include a purchase button and a count of Auto Clickers.

### FEATURE 5 : Create a header with a link to a drop down element with information about the Company.
> As the marketing director, I want the customers to be able to find out more information about Fred the Baker Baking Company, so that they will buy more stuff from us.
- Create a header and add a link that will make company info pop up for the user.

### FEATURE 6 : Create a header with a link to the Inspiration of our game.
> As the game designer, I want to give gamers a reference to our inspiration, the original Cookie Clicker game, so that the legal department will stop complaining that we stole the idea.
- Create another link that will open a new tab with Cookie Clicker's address.
- 
### FEATURE 7 : Create a header with a link to a drop down element with information about the Developer.
> As the developer, I want credit for writing this application, so that I can get a job.
- Create a modal element that is centered over the application and has a quick bio link about yourself and links to your portfolio and GitHub.com account.
----
## Iteration 3
This iteration will wire up your DonutMaker.js file to the index.html file and use the app.js file to link the two.

### FEATURE 1 : When you click the clicker button the Donut counter should change.
> As a user, I want to see my Donut count go up when I click the clicker button, so that I can be rewarded for my hard work.
- When the clicker button is pressed the Donut count element should change value.

### FEATURE 2 : The Auto Clickers purchase button should be grayed out and unresponsive if there are not enough donuts to buy the next item.
> As a game designer, I want the user to have a visual clue that they cannot perform a game action, so that the user isn't frustrated by clicking buttons that can not do anything.
- When the donut count is below the cost of a purchasable item, grey out or change the appearance of the button.
- Clicking the button when an item cannot be purchased should not perform any action.

### FEATURE 3 : The Auto Clicker count should be displayed.
> As a user, I want to know how many Auto Clickers I have, so that I can brag to my friends.
- The amount of items purchased should be displayed in the same area as the button to purchase them.
- The amount of items purchased should be updated after each purchase.

### FEATURE 4 : The Auto Clickers in clicks should be displayed.
> As a user, I want to know how many clicks I have to click before I can purchase an Auto Clicker so that I know when I get to stop clicking.
- Display the cost of the Auto Clickers in their purchase button or in an element nearby.
- Update the costs whenever the price is changed.
 

## Iteration 4
This iteration is for you to complete final project requirements.

### FEATURE 1 : Implement a way to reset the game.
> As a user, I want to be able to reset my game, so that my coworkers won't know how much time I wasted on clicking a button.
- Have a way to stay on the same page, but reset the state of the game.
